# Wasabi Audio Plugin

## Overview

Wasabi is a versatile audio distortion plugin developed using the JUCE framework, designed to deliver a range of distortion effects for music producers and audio engineers. Inspired by the bold and spicy flavors of wasabi, this plugin offers a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls to shape your sound, from subtle warmth to aggressive crunch.

## Features

### Distortion Types
Wasabi provides three distinct distortion algorithms, each accessible via dedicated katakana-labeled buttons:
- **ワ (Wa)**: Smooth, warm tanh-based distortion for a rich, rounded tone.
- **サ (Sa)**: Sharp, aggressive hard-clipping distortion for a biting edge.
- **ビ (Bi)**: Complex wavefolding distortion for intricate, harmonically rich textures.

### Parameter Controls
Fine-tune your sound with six rotary sliders:
- **Drive**: Adjusts the intensity of the distortion effect (0.0 to 2.0).
- **Range**: Controls the distortion range for additional tonal shaping (0.0 to 5.0).
- **Blend**: Mixes the dry and wet signals for parallel processing (0.0 to 1.0).
- **Volume**: Sets the output level to balance the processed signal (0.0 to 2.0).
- **Hi-Pass**: High-pass filter to cut low frequencies (50 Hz to 500 Hz).
- **Lo-Pass**: Low-pass filter to tame high frequencies (2 kHz to 12 kHz).

### XY Pad
An interactive XY pad allows simultaneous control of:
- **Mid Frequency**: Adjusts the center frequency of the mid-band EQ (horizontal axis).
- **Mid Gain**: Boosts or cuts the mid-band gain (vertical axis).
The pad provides a visual and intuitive way to sculpt the midrange, with a dot indicating the current settings.

### Presets
Wasabi includes five carefully crafted presets to jumpstart your creativity:
- **Wasabi Warfare**: Intense, aggressive distortion for heavy tones.
- **Up Your Nose**: Bright, cutting sound with pronounced highs.
- **Sushi Roll**: Smooth, warm distortion with balanced mids.
- **Soy Sauce**: Subtle, clean boost with minimal distortion.
- **Soba**: Neutral, versatile setting for general use.

### Bypass
A toggleable **Bypass** button allows you to quickly enable or disable the effect, making it easy to compare the processed and unprocessed signal.
